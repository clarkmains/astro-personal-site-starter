## Updating content

Understanding Astro's use of [Frontmatter and Markdown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) is helpful here.

The content of the page is driven entirely by the following file:

    /src/pages/index.md

What follows is a breakdown of how the different sections of the page are populated from this file.

### Header section

Headshot image is stored in `/public` and configured as follows:

    image: "/headshot.jpeg"

Page heading e.g. your name:

    name: Daphne Blake

Page sub-heading:

    description: Hey! I'm Daphne, a Web Developer & UX Designer based in Glasgow, Scotland.

### About section

The content of this section is populated by the Markdown slot, so is flexible and can contain rich content such as images etc.

Tailwind's [Typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) is used to format the Markdown.

    period: Jun 2019 - Now

The `period` is treated as one string so you can include terms like "Now" or "Current".

### Contact section
